<li>There is one voice control car robot(This car work on some of the voice command like turn left, turn forward etc.). Basic code maybe need some improvement but okay.</li>
<li>Now there is also an obstacle avoiding robot(this robot detect any obstacle by the sensor and then take the left or right by analysing both the situation).</li>
<li>Last one is the normal bluetooth control car the bluetooth module use in the car get connected with the mobile or you can make a controller by yourself. Or you can use the wifi aurdino.</li>
